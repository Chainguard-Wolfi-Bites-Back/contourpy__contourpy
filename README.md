# ContourPy

Python library for calculating contours of 2D quadrilateral grids.

Work in progress...

Will include current and previous Matplotlib contouring algorithms, plus a new
faster and more flexible one.  Intention is to allow Python libraries to use
contouring algorithms without having to have Matplotlib as a dependency.

To build

    python setup.py install

To run tests

    pytest
